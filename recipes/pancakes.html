<h2>A fluffy pancake made with ricotta</h2>
    <p>The fluffiest ricotta pancakes you'll ever eat.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>2 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp fine sea salt</li>
        <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 tbsp neutral-tasting oil</li>
        <li>1 cup ricotta</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Topping(s) of choice</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, salt, and lemon zest until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>In a separate medium bowl, whisk the eggs. Then whisk in the milk, oil, and ricotta until you have a homogeneous mixture.</li>
        <li>Add the ricotta-milk mixture to the flour mixture, and whisk until combined. Lumps are okay. Let the mixture rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Lightly grease the pan with butter or spray lightly with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Once the pan is hot, add butter to the pan in 1/4-cup measurements, spacing them far enough apart to avoid them forming together.</li>
        <li>Cook pancakes for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown on the bottom and beginning to bubble on the top. Flip and cook for 2-3 minutes more. Transfer to plate, repeat, and enjoy.</li>
